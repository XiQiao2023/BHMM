BHMMSimulation.R is used to run simulation study for Bayesian hierarchical mediation model (BHMM). One can specify the assumption of independent mediators or correlated mediators, different number of mediators and various effect sizes. Gibbs sampling algorithm seamlessly integrated by C++ using R package Rcpp is provided (Rcpp.cpp) to generate posterior distributions of parameters. Rcpp and Rcpparmadillo package is requires to source the .cpp document. We also provide same sampling algorithm in plain R language (Gibbs_Cor.R). Note that Rcpp.cpp is more computation effecient than Gibbs_Cor.R. UMAsimulation.R is used to run simulation study for univariate mediation analysis(UMA) as comparison for BHMM.
